                    After high school I went to The Conservatory of Recording Arts where I got my certificaion in Audio Engineering. Although I didnt pursue a career in that field, I still enjoy it as a hobby. I played many musical intruments in high school and also played in several bands playing the drums or piano.

                    I currently drive semi trucks and have been doing so for 5 years now. I was always interested in web development and coding, but never had the opportunity until now. I hope to learn as much as I can while attending this bootcamp and maybe take the next step towards my career change!
